# html-technical-project
An HTML project for the final 12th grade exam (spring 2024)

The project was created as a Professional Competency Project for the final 12th grade exam. It consists of several HTML files representing linked web pages, formatted using CSS and including many photos and videos to exemplify the most commonly used commands in HTML. 
For a consistent and intuitive structure, the chosen topic is the history of the NBA Playoffs. This way, the project can be split into well-defined sections with links between one another and a "main menu" page that preserves the overall logic of the project.
